Hello and welcome to my blog about security and embbeded design!

About author:

Adam Kostrzewa - For the past eight years I have been involved in academic research and industrial consulting in the domain of automotive electronic; in particular, real-time, embedded systems for applications which can be critical to the safety of users. In my spare time I am a data security enthusiast. I find especially interesting hardware aspects of circuit implementation which are often not that transparent and thoroughly tested as software. I hold a dual Master Degree from Warsaw University of Technology and Technical University Berlin where I developed an open-source based, man-in- the-middle attack on the GSM interface.
